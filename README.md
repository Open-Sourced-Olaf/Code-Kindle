A ReactJS webapp to convert source code into pseudocode using SMT( Statistical Machine Translation).

## How does it work

- The converter page contains two editors, one for writing the source code that you want to convert and the other one which will display the
pseudocode after the conversion.
- You can also upload the file to be converted by firstly choosing the language from the dropdown menu and then browsing the file and uploading it.
- The file that you chose will also be displayed in the text editor.
- Now, just click on the convert button, it will run the docker container based compiler in the background.

## Future Scopes
- Add support to more languages
- Convert one language code into other like cpp code to php and so on.
- Improving the algorithm of the translator to include complex cases like multiple functional calls inside the main.


## Project Structure
- `backend` folder contains the code for the Django based API to upload the files into the projects directory.
- `code_converter` folder contains the frontend code deployed on DFINITY.
- `cpp-pseudogen` folder contains the translator code for cpp/c languages.
- `frontend` folder contains the UI of the entire webapp.
- `python-scripts` folder contains the translator for python source code.

## How to run the project locally.
- To translate the cpp/c codes,move to the cpp-pseudogen folder upload a file named "prog.cpp" and then compile the main.cpp using the command
 `g++ main.cpp -o main` after that execute `./main`, it will display the output in the terminal as well as create a output.text file.
 - To translate the python code, move to the python-scripts folder, upload a file named hello.py, then compile the generate-pseudo.py file using the
   `python3 generate-pseudo.py`, it will produce hello-pseudo file in the working directory.
  - to run the frontend code, move to the frontend directory and run `npm i` followed by `npm start`.
 - to deploy and run the code on DFINITY, run `dfx start --background` to start the server in the background, then run `dfx deploy`, it will produce a      code_converter_assets canister id, copy that.
 - then open dfx.json and find the ip address, now the url of the web app will be http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=[canister-id].
 - to deploy, run `dfx ping ic`, `dfx deploy --network=ic`.
 - the deployed url will be https://[ your canisterId here ].ic0.app/
